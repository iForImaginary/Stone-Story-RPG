# Stone Story RPG
Stone Story RPG is an ASCII-art game that can be found in Steam (pc) or app stores (mobile). For all who find this page I would expect to have some knowledge of the game contents, so let's continue to... 
## What is this respository about? 
Basically, stone scripts I wrote throughout gameplay, as well as some other stuff maybe, which may be helpful to newbies just like me. 

In each file I would include the script, the condition (written time, equipment level, enchantment etc.) and outcome of the runs using the script and under the condition described. 
## However... 
The disclaimer is, I AM SURE THE SCRIPTS MAY NOT BE THE VERY BEST. 

As I already said, I am a newbie myself with limited expertise in coding, so I can only guarantee that it performed as I described under the condition when I performed it. 

Of course, if I found a better script, I would update it. 
## So, 
Hopefully this would be of some help to those who wandered pass - use it as reference if it pleases. 

If not, see it as a game play record. 
## PS
People who wish to discuss the game or anything I wrote friendly are more than welcome.
